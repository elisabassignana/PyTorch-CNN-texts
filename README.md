# PyTorch-CNN-texts
This repository aims to compare two possible ways to implement a CNN for text classification using PyTorch.
It is not clear if the right implementation should use conv1d or conv2d.
With this minimalistic example I show that, with the right parameter settings, they perform the same operation, leading to the same results.

This sample is strictly about implementation.
For theory and conceptualization about CNNs for Text Classification, I suggest to take a look [here](https://cezannec.github.io/CNN_Text_Classification/).
