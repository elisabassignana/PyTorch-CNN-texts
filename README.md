# PyTorch-CNN-texts
This repository aims to compare two possible ways to implement a CNN for text classification using PyTorch.
It is not clear if the right implementation should use conv1d or conv2d.
With this minimalistic example I show that, with the right parameter settings, they perform the same operation, leading to the same results.
